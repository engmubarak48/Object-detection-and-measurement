# Object-detection-and-measurement

The Aim of this project is detect all objects on a board and check if they are placed at the wrong loacation or not. if one or more objects on the board is at wrong location we should detect the number of objects that are in different position and put red color on it.

Image in the repo demonstrates what the software is doing but the code was not developed for that specific board. So it might not work on this image. but you can costumize it for your own images/problem.
